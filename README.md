# Diophantine EQuations

A Diophantine equation is a polynomial equation, usually
in several variables, and solving it usually comprises
of finding either one, or all of, the solutions where
the variables take either integer, or rational, values.

This repository consists of solutions to Diophantine
equations in the Lean Theorem Prover.
